# 30 Days of ML
30 Days of ML is designed for people who want to learn ML by Kaggle in 30 Days

## About the Tutorials and Hands On Exercises

The program started on Monday, August 2, and lasts four weeks (Tuesday, August 31). It is designed for people who:

* Have not coded in Python much (or at all!)
* Want to make the most of Kaggle, but aren't sure how.

## Welcome to the 30 Days of ML competition!

For the final two weeks of the program, you will work on this competition, open only to people who have signed up for the 30 Days of ML program. The top 10 teams will receive swag as prizes!

### About the data

The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic (and generated using a CTGAN), but based on a real dataset. The original dataset deals with predicting the amount of an insurance claim. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

### How to spend the next two weeks: keep learning!

Aim to make at least one submission per day. Even if you are low on time, you can learn a lot from this exercise, and it is very motivating to gradually move up the leaderboard!

As described in the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-kaggle-competitions) above, the best way to keep learning from the community is through the Discussion tab and Code tab above.

* Through the Discussion tab, you can chat with users about ideas or doubts that you have, or find a team to work with.
* Through the Code tab, you can share your code and also learn from code that other Kagglers have shared with the community.

If you're interested in learning new skills through courses, check out the [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) and [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) courses, which teach new techniques that could be relevant for working with the competition data.

The data for this competition is closely related to the [Tabular Playground Series - Feb 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2021) competition. Refer to the [Code tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2021/code) and the [Discussion tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2021/discussion) for ideas of algorithms that you might like to try, that may also perform well in this competition!
